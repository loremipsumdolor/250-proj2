a bag of eggplants
a fond childhood memory
a meme
Donald Trump's hair
a dysfunctional family
an apocalypse
a singing whale
a killer sheep
an undead president
a stab wound
alcoholism
self-loathing
your inner demons
a stressed college student
the dinosaur Santa Claus
a Canadian goose
the last ghost that haunted you
the season between winter and spring
a romantic dinner
a date gone awry
a swarm of bees
a lobotomy
spontaneous combustion
a powerpoint presentation
the last thing you ate
democracy
freedom
a utopian future
a dystopian future
a quest to catch them all
a pizza monster
the boss fight to graduate
the ultimate dad joke
what you spent your last dollar on
Godzilla, but anthropomorphized to look like Bill Tsutsui
your greatest fear
what you hate most in the world
everything wrong with your life
a fictional sibling
your dream vacation
how you would like to die
your favorite animal
the place you call home
a trauma
the face of death
your mom
your dad
an inside joke
reasons for living
the worst music you have heard
sex with a hotpocket
